            <div class="text">Computer Science and Engineering</div>
            <div class="quats"> Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an engineering discipline that covers several
              topics related to computation, programming languages, program design, computer hardware and software and
              integrates several fields of computer science. It is one of the trending subjects which students pursue
              after completing Class 12. CSE is a four-year undergraduate course which involves various aspects needed
              for the creation of a computer system.</div>

            <div class="quats">Electronics and communication engineering (ECE) is a discipline of engineering that
              involves developing and testing electronic circuits and communication devices like transmitters, receivers
              and integrated circuits.
              Electronics and communication engineering (ECE) comprises communication engineering and the core of
              electrical engineering. A career in this field can be very diverse and rewarding. Knowing more about this
              profession will help you determine if it is the right career path for you </div>

            <div class="quats">Information Technology is technology solutions for organizational and business problems.
              This engineering field utilizes computers, networks, storage, and other technological infrastructure, both
              software & hardware, to deal with and use information/data.
              The B.E in Information Technology degree topics covers typically the study of the three main scopes of
              specialization in Information Technology namely network administration, computer support, and programming.

            <div class="quats"> Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers
              center on creating technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has
              probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.

              This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy,
              transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.</div>

            <div class="quats"> Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of engineering, and dates back to
              the late 19th century. It is the branch of engineering that deals with the technology of electricity.
              Electrical engineers work on a wide range of components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge
              power station generators.</div>

              get jobs in government and private companies. Landing in a multinational company can fetch from Rs. 4-6
              lakh for freshers. Emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics are
              involved in Instrumentation Engineering. This reflects that there are copious chances across these
              upcoming technical domains.</div>
